This means that **the plugin will work only if the Jetpack plugin is already installed on your Wordpress platform with the Publicize module set to active**. Don't worry, tho: if any of these requirements are missing this plugin won't do anything, without breaking your blog or compromising its performance in any way.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\n**IMPORTANT**: This plugin requires Jetpack's Publicize module: read below for additional info.\r\n\r\nAs the name says, this plugin will automatically append hashtags to any content sent by **Jetpack's Publicize** module. This means that **the plugin will work only if the Jetpack plugin is already installed on your Wordpress platform with the Publicize module set to active**. Don't worry, tho: if any of these requirements are missing this plugin won't do anything, without breaking your blog or compromising its performance in any way.\r\n\r\n## Plugin Features\r\n\r\n* Hashtags will be created using the post `tags`, (optionally) trimming the space chars, until the maximum character length is reached (if any).\r\n* You'll still be able to manually add custom hashtags, pre-pending or appending them to the auto-generated ones just like you always did.\r\n* You can reorder the hashtags as you like, regardless of how they were added.\r\n* Dupe check included, ensuring that the same hashtag won't be included multiple times - unless you manually do that.\r\n* Automatically added hashtags won't break the *118-character limits* of the social message text to keep the message length under the standard *tweet + link* limit.\r\n* The above character-length threshold can be changed and/or set to infinite with ease.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nGo to the **Plugins > Add New...** panel in the WP Admin interface, search for \"publicize with hashtags\" and click **Install**.\r\n\r\nIf you prefer to install the plugin manually, you can do the following:\r\n\r\n1. Go to the [plugin page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/publicize-with-hashtags/) on the Wordpress Plugin Browser and click the **Download** button to get the latest version to your HDD.\r\n2. Upload the **publicize-with-hashtags.zip** file using the Wordpress *upload plugin* feature OR unpack its contents inside the `/wp-content/plugins/` folder.\r\n3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.\r\n4. Take a look at the plugin's source code and change its default settings if needed.\r\n\r\n## Frequently Asked Questions\r\n\r\n#### What if I manually insert one or more hashtags?\r\n\r\nThey will be kept as they are: the plugin won't strip out anything, it will simply add the \"missing\" hashtags to the Custom Message box.\r\n\r\n#### What if I already inserted an hashtags identical to an existing post tag?\r\n\r\nIt won't be added again, as long as it's case-insensitive equal to the first one. The plugin will never insert a dupe hashtag on its own.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n![alt text](https://s.w.org/plugins/publicize-with-hashtags/screenshot-1.jpg?r=1217800 \"Plugin at work on the Jetpack's Publicize Widget Custom Message box\")\r\n\r\n*The plugin will automatically trasform your post tags to hashtags and append them to the Publicize Widget's Custom Message box. Any existing, manually inserted hashtag will be kept and/or won't be added a second time if also included as a tag.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Useful Links\r\n\r\n* [Plugin official page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/publicize-with-hashtags/) on Wordpress.org Plugin Browser.\r\n* [Plugin SVN Repository](http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/publicize-with-hashtags/) hosted by Wordpress.org (in real-time sync with the GitHub repo).\r\n* [Plugin GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Darkseal/publicize-with-hashtags) (in real-time sync with the SVN repo).\r\n* [Plugin GitHub Page](http://darkseal.github.io/publicize-with-hashtags/).\r\n* TODO: Plugin official page at [Ryadel.com](https://www.ryadel.com/).\r\n* TODO: Ryadel.com article explaining how to use-it.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n#### 0.1.1\r\n* Added an explicative screenshot\r\n* Added some Frequently Asked Questions\r\n* Small changes to readme.txt\r\n\r\n#### 0.1\r\n* First release.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Authors\r\n\r\n* **Darkseal** of [Ryadel.com](http://www.ryadel.com/).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Support\r\nYou can support this project's development by clicking on the following button.\r\n  \r\n[<img src=\"https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donate_LG.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Donate\">](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=JSTHA4HMVSQ8J)\r\n  \r\n Thanks a lot!","google":"UA-55895187-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
